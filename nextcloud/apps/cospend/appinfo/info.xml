# Nextcloud Cospend 💰

Nextcloud Cospend is a group/shared budget manager. It was inspired by the great [IHateMoney](https://github.com/spiral-project/ihatemoney/).

You can use it when you share a house, when you go on vacation with friends, whenever you share money with others.

It lets you create projects with members and bills. Each member has a balance computed from the project bills. This way you can see who owes the group and who the group owes. Ultimately you can ask for a settlement plan telling you which payments to make to reset members balances.

Project members are independent from Nextcloud users. Projects can be accessed and modified by people without a Nextcloud account. Each project has an ID and a password for guest access.

[MoneyBuster](https://gitlab.com/eneiluj/moneybuster) Android client is [available in F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/packages/net.eneiluj.moneybuster/) and on the [Play store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.eneiluj.moneybuster).

## Features

* ✎ create/edit/delete projects, members, bills
* ⚖ check member balances
* 🗠 display project statistics
* ♻ display settlement plan
* 🎇 automatically create reimbursement bills from settlement plan
* 🗓 create recurring bills (daily/weekly/monthly/yearly)
* 📊 optionally provide custom amount for each member in new bills
* 🔗 insert public link to a personal file in bill description (picture of physical bill for example)
* 👩 guest access for people outside Nextcloud
* 👫 share projects with Nextcloud users/groups
* 🖫 import/export projects as csv (compatible with csv files from IHateMoney)
* 🖧 add external projects (hosted by another Nextcloud instance)
* 🔗 generate link/QRCode to easily import projects in MoneyBuster
* 🗲 implement Nextcloud notifications and activity stream

# Nextcloud Cospend 💰

Το Nextcloud Cospend είναι ένας ομαδικός/κοινόχρηστος διαχειριστής προϋπολογισμού. Εμπνευσμένο από το μεγάλο [IHateMoney](https://github.com/spiral-project/ihatemoney/).

Μπορείτε να το χρησιμοποιήσετε όταν μοιράζεστε ένα σπίτι, όταν κάνετε διακοπές με φίλους, όποτε μοιράζεστε χρήματα με άλλους.

Σας επιτρέπει να δημιουργείτε έργα με μέλη και λογαριασμούς. Κάθε μέλος έχει ένα υπόλοιπο λογαριασμού που υπολογίζεται από τους λογαριασμούς του έργου. Με αυτόν τον τρόπο μπορείτε να δείτε ποιος χρωστάει στην ομάδα και σε ποιον οφείλει η ομάδα. Εν τέλει μπορείτε να ζητήσετε για ένα σχέδιο διακανονισμού, το οποίο θα σας ενημερώνει σχετικά με τις πληρωμές που πρέπει να κάνετε για να ισορροπήσετε τα υπόλοιπα των μελών.

Τα μέλη του έργου είναι ανεξάρτητα από τους χρήστες του Nextcloud. Στα έργα μπορούν να έχουν πρόσβαση και να τα τροποποιήσουν άτομα χωρίς λογαριασμό Nextcloud. Κάθε έργο έχει αναγνωριστικό και κωδικό πρόσβασης για την πρόσβαση των επισκεπτών.

Η Android εφαρμογή του [MoneyBuster](https://gitlab.com/eneiluj/moneybuster) είναι [διαθέσιμη στο F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/packages/net.eneiluj.moneybuster/) και στο [Play store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.eneiluj.moneybuster).

## Δυνατότητες

* ✎ δημιουργία / επεξεργασία / διαγραφή έργων, μελών, λογαριασμών
* ⚖ έλεγχος υπολοίπου μελών
* 🗠 προβολή στατιστικών στοιχείων έργου
* ♻ προβολή σχεδίου διακανονισμού
* 🎇 αυτόματη δημιουργία λογαριασμού αποζημίωσης από το σχέδιο διακανονισμού
* 🗓 δημιουργία επαναλαμβανόμενων λογαριασμών (ημέρα/εβδομάδα/μήνας/έτος)
* 📊 προαιρετική παροχή προσαρμοσμένου ποσού για κάθε μέλος σε νέους λογαριασμούς
* 🔗 εισαγωγή δημόσιου συνδέσμου σε ένα προσωπικό αρχείο στην περιγραφή του λογαριασμού (για παράδειγμα εικόνα του φυσικού λογαριασμού)
* 👩 πρόσβαση επισκεπτών για άτομα εκτός του Nextcloud
* 👫 κοινοποίηση έργων με χρήστες / ομάδες του Nextcloud
* 🖫 εισαγωγή / εξαγωγή έργων σε csv (συμβατά με αρχεία csv από το IHateMoney)
* 🖧 προσθήκη εξωτερικών έργων (που φιλοξενούνται σε άλλη εγκατάσταση του Nextcloud)
* 🔗 δημιουργία συνδέσμου / QRCode για εύκολη εισαγωγή έργων στο MoneyBuster
* 🗲 εφαρμογή ειδοποιήσεων Nextcloud και ροής δραστηριότητας

# Nextcloud Cospend 💰

Nextcloud Cospend is a group/shared budget manager. It was inspired by the great [IHateMoney](https://github.com/spiral-project/ihatemoney/).

You can use it when you share a house, when you go on vacation with friends, whenever you share money with others.

It lets you create projects with members and bills. Each member has a balance computed from the project bills. This way you can see who owes the group and who the group owes. Ultimately you can ask for a settlement plan telling you which payments to make to reset members balances.

Project members are independent from Nextcloud users. Projects can be accessed and modified by people without a Nextcloud account. Each project has an ID and a password for guest access.

[MoneyBuster](https://gitlab.com/eneiluj/moneybuster) Android client is [available in F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/packages/net.eneiluj.moneybuster/) and on the [Play store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.eneiluj.moneybuster).

# Nextcloud Cospend 💰

Nextcloud Cospend es un gestor de presupuesto compartido. Fue inspirado por el magnífico [IHateMoney](https://github.com/spiral-project/ihatemoney/).

Puedes usarlo cuando compartes una casa, cuando vas de vacaciones con tus amigos, siempre que compartas dinero con otros.

Te permite crear proyectos con miembros y facturas. Cada miembro tiene un saldo calculado a partir de las facturas del proyecto. De esta manera se puede ver quién debe al grupo y a quién debe el grupo. En última instancia, puedes pedir un plan de liquidación diciendo qué pagos hacer para restablecer los saldos de los miembros.

Los miembros del proyecto son independientes de los usuarios de Nextcloud. Los proyectos pueden ser accedidos y modificados por personas sin una cuenta de Nextcloud. Cada proyecto tiene un ID y una contraseña para el acceso de invitados.

El cliente para Android [MoneyBuster](https://gitlab.com/eneiluj/moneybuster) está [disponible en F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/packages/net.eneiluj.moneybuster/) y en la [Play store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.eneiluj.moneybuster).

# Nextcloud Cospend 💰

Nextcloud Cospend is a group/shared budget manager. It was inspired by the great [IHateMoney](https://github.com/spiral-project/ihatemoney/).

You can use it when you share a house, when you go on vacation with friends, whenever you share money with others.

It lets you create projects with members and bills. Each member has a balance computed from the project bills. This way you can see who owes the group and who the group owes. Ultimately you can ask for a settlement plan telling you which payments to make to reset members balances.

Project members are independent from Nextcloud users. Projects can be accessed and modified by people without a Nextcloud account. Each project has an ID and a password for guest access.

[MoneyBuster](https://gitlab.com/eneiluj/moneybuster) Android client is [available in F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/packages/net.eneiluj.moneybuster/) and on the [Play store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.eneiluj.moneybuster).

## Features

* ✎ create/edit/delete projects, members, bills
* ⚖ check member balances
* 🗠 display project statistics
* ♻ display settlement plan
* 🎇 automatically create reimbursement bills from settlement plan
* 🗓 create recurring bills (daily/weekly/monthly/yearly)

# Проект Cospend для Nextcloud

Nextcloud Cospend - это менеджер группового/общего бюджета. Он был создан под впечатлением от отличной программы [IHateMoney](https://github.com/spiral-project/ihatemoney/).

Он пригодится, когда вы вскладчину снимаете жильё, или когда едете в отпуск с друзьями, в случаях, когда вы скидываетесь на что-либо.

Он позволяет вам создавать проекты в которых есть участники и счета. Баланс каждого участника вычисляется на основании заведенных в проект счетов. Таки образом сразу видно кто должен всей группе, а кому должна группа. В завершение проекта можно вычислить план расчетов по платежам для обнуления балансов участников.

Участники проекта не связаны с пользователями Nextcloud. Доступ к проектам и к редактированию их данных могут иметь люди и без регистрации в Nextcloud. У каждого проекта есть уникальный идентификатор и пароль для входа с гостевым доступом.

Клиент [MoneyBuster](https://gitlab.com/eneiluj/moneybuster) для Android [ доступен в F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/packages/net.eneiluj.moneybuster/) и в [Play store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.eneiluj.moneybuster).

## Возможности

* ✎ Создание/редактирование/удаление проектов, участников, счетов
* ⚖ проверка балансов участников
* 🗠 отображение статистики проекта
* ♻ план расчета
* 🎇 автоматическое создание счетов на возмещение из плана расчёта
* 🗓 создание повторяющихся счетов (ежедневно/еженедельно/ежемесячно/ежегодно)
* 📊 возможность устрановить произвольную сумму для каждого участника во вводимых счетах
* 🔗 вставка публичной ссылки на личный файл в описание счета (например, фото бумажного счета)
* 👩 гостевой доступ вне Nextcloud
* 👫 разделение проекта с другими пользователями/группами Nextcloud
* 🖫 Импорт/экспорт проектов в формате csv (совместим с csv файлами из IHateMoney)
* 🖧 добавление внешних проектов (размещенных на другом сервере Nextcloud)
* 🔗 создание ссылки/QRCode для легкого импорта проектов в MoneyBuster
* 🗲 добавление уведомлений в список активностей и нотификации Nextcloud

Это приложение протестировано на Nextcloud 17 с Firefox 57+ и Chromium.

Это приложение находится в стадии разработки.

# Nextcloud Cospend 💰

Nextcloud Cospend is a group/shared budget manager. It was inspired by the great [IHateMoney](https://github.com/spiral-project/ihatemoney/).

You can use it when you share a house, when you go on vacation with friends, whenever you share money with others.

It lets you create projects with members and bills. Each member has a balance computed from the project bills. This way you can see who owes the group and who the group owes. Ultimately you can ask for a settlement plan telling you which payments to make to reset members balances.

Project members are independent from Nextcloud users. Projects can be accessed and modified by people without a Nextcloud account. Each project has an ID and a password for guest access.

[MoneyBuster](https://gitlab.com/eneiluj/moneybuster) Android client is [available in F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/packages/net.eneiluj.moneybuster/) and on the [Play store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.eneiluj.moneybuster).

## Features

* ✎ create/edit/delete projects, members, bills
* ⚖ check member balances
* 🗠 display project statistics
* ♻ display settlement plan
* 🎇 automatically create reimbursement bills from settlement plan
* 🗓 create recurring bills (daily/weekly/monthly/yearly)
* 📊 optionally provide custom amount for each member in new bills
* 🔗 insert public link to a personal file in bill description (picture of physical bill for example)
