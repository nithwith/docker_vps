## Getting started
First you need docker, and that's pretty much it. Then just follow these steps:

1. `docker network create web` Creates the web-network that we will use across docker containers.
2. `docker-compose up -d`, this starts all containers.

You can have all the sites you like, this should be no problem, just update the labels for docker.
